Review of paper:
"Simple Replication in Structured Peer-to-Peer Networks"


Summary:
The paper discusses, how to increase availability of data in a p2p-based DHT(Distributed Hash Table), when nodes, which carry unique data, randomly go offline or online (churn).
To provide high data availability, nodes usually replicate data onto other nodes.
The paper presents a replication strategy applicable for p2p-based DHT's, called "simple replication protocol", where data is replicated on a configurable number of nodes, whose ID's are computed by (re-)hashing the initial hash of the data.
Instead of a single Master-Replication-Node, the protocol uses a Multi-Master-Replication-Node model, where each Replication-Node is considered a Master-Node.
Therefore, all Replication-Nodes care about replication (No single point of failure).
This protocol supports the common (CRUD) create-read-update-delete operations.
In case of concurrent data updates, consistency is maintained using a version counter.
Due to simplicity, this mechanism is also used for creating and deleting data, by using zero or infinity as version counters respectively.
Evaluation shows, a replication degree of three is often enough to provide high availability.


Improvements:
- Authors compare their solution to the PAST protocol, based on Pastry.
While relevant, maybe there would have been more interesting (newer?) solutions for comparison.

- Using the update mechanism for creating and deleting seems practical.
However, for deleting the meta data + version counter have to stay in the network.
Otherwise, uninformed nodes, which were offline during the deletion phase and are going online again, could re-create the data.
Maybe authors could be more specific, which counter-measures could be applied (besides timeouts), to reliably delete data.

- Overall, the evaluation parameters are well chosen and the results are easy to understand.
However, the data size was consistently set to 15KB, which is not very much.
The evaluation shows, that the overhead is inherently influenced by the replication degree and the data size.
So, simulating different data sizes would definitely be of interest. (But Authors already consider this for future work)

- Security was never mentioned. Maybe this could be mentioned somehow ?


Language:
- Sentence construction seems to be heavily influenced by German. (Lots of sentences are not very idiomatic)
- In Section 3.A the word "isnt" is used. However, "is not" should be used for formal writing.
- Often words like (obviously, etc.) are used, but scientists should obviously never claim, that something is obvious ;)
- Some sentences are just too long and complex, keep it simple and precise.
- Probably personal taste: I would not use the first person too often. Using third person and simple present seem more appropriate.


Layout:
- Good and logical structure
- Font of figures could have been larger (preferable same size as text, if possible)
- The result table would probably benefit from choosing another visualization (maybe multiple tables..?)
- Half-blank pages often look incomplete (last page). It is difficult to finish a paper evenly, but maybe there is a way to fill the last page ?


Overall:
- Good and interesting paper
- Good presentation of problem, solution, related work and evaluation
- Room for improvements: Language (medium), Layout (minor), Content (minor)


Good luck during presentation!
