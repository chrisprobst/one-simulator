Review of paper:
"Evaluation of Ad-Hoc Radio Communication on Android Smartphones"


Summary:
The paper evaluates different wireless communication techniques (WiFi, Bluetooth), provided by android devices like mobile phones or tables, in terms of metrics like transmission speed, bandwidth and connection delay.
Therefore, two applications have been developed.
The first application, which is called "Waitress", acts as server and responds to client requests, generated by the second application, called "Clientele", by sending a large block of binary data.
The results of all metrics are gathered using different scenarios and evaluated later on.
Evaluation shows, that WiFi is roughly 55x faster than Bluetooth, but bandwidth drops exponentially with a maximum distance of 110 meters.
On the contrary, Bluetooth provides a consistent bandwidth and has a maximum range of 100 meters.


Improvements:
- Authors should explain the difference of WiFi and WiFi Direct in more detail.
-- What is the difference between WiFi Server and WiFi Hotspot ?

- The graphs using the results gathered during the evaluation are spiky (caused by real measurements)
-- Therefore: Multiple measurements ? Plots should consider Mean/Min/Max/Standard-Deviation for each data set.
--- Also: Evaluation talks about "square root decreasing", why not showing a real square root decrease in the plot ?

- It would be interesting to know, why Bluetooth remains so stable over the whole distance.
-- Probably further measurements ? More related work ?

- There is not a future work section, why not ? I bet, there is a multiple of interesting projects based on these principles.

- Overall the paper seems a bit short. Most sections seem very minimalistic. (no offense ;))


Language:
- Funny, but not very scientific
-- II.: "I want to get Credit Points for my study" -> Really =D ?

- Sentence construction seems to be heavily influenced by German. (Lots of sentences are not very idiomatic)
-- III.: "Here it is similiar to ..."
-- Abstract: "to send messages or something other data"

- Some sentences are just too long and complex, keep it simple and precise.

- Also, there are some very strange sentences
-- Abstract: "attach importance" ?
-- "generate a client"
-- "we had to added the opening process"

- Syntactically, there are multiple mistakes:
-- II.: "an short overwiev" -> a short overview
-- III.: "Both applications" -> Do you mean: Two applications ?
-- Lots of missing s letters for he/she/it
-- IV.: "wheater" -> weather

- Formal writing:
-- Probably personal taste: I would not use the first person too often. Using third person and simple present seem more appropriate.
-- III.: "following subsections" -> I would just write Sections (capital S).


Layout:
- Logical structure
- Font of figures could have been larger (preferable same size as text, if possible)
- Half-blank pages often look incomplete (last page). It is difficult to finish a paper evenly, but maybe there is a way to fill the last page ?


Overall:
- Interesting topic, overall well presented
- Language can be improved
- Further content would be more satisfying for an interested reader
- Layout is ok, but could also be improved
- Room for improvements: Language (major), Layout (minor), Content (medium)


Good luck during presentation!
