Review of paper:
"MANET Testbed with Raspberry PIs"


Summary:
The paper investigates the impact of using real devices (Raspberry PIs) instead of a simulator, when building MANETs.
Active research concentrates too much on using simulators or only a single routing algorithm.
Therefore, in this paper a testbed consisting of three scenarios is created, which are tested with two different routing algorithms.
The scenarios differ in terms of locality and barriers, which could influence WiFi performance.
In all scenarios, a node tries to download a file from the internet over the remaining nodes, which are all connected in a row.
The authors achieve this by keeping the distance between the nodes high enough, so that a node is only connected to its predecessor and sucessor.
This way, the impact of the hop count on the bandwidth can easily be measured.
For comparison, the authors considered the Babel and OLSR routing protocol, whose pros and cons are explained in detail.
Evaluation shows, that obstacles like humans or even rain can heavily influence WiFi connectivity and routing performance.
Also, the bandwidth often drops rapidly during the first hop, the reason is still unknown.


Improvements:
- Authors did only single measurements per scenario
-- Running each scenario multiple times + Mean/Min/Max/Standard-Deviation should deliver more scientific value

- Although there is a plan of the building, there is no way to extrapolate real distances from it.
-- Therefore: Maybe a more detailed plan of the individual scenarios (meter, obstacles, multiple runs) ?


Language:
- Sentence construction seems to be heavily influenced by German. (Lots of sentences are not very idiomatic)

- Sometimes, words like "isn't" or "doesn't" are used. However, "is not" / "does not" should be used for formal writing.

- He/She/It - das 's' muss mit ;), the rest of the personal pronouns do not get a trailing 's' =(
-- So nodes _go_ up or down, not "goes"
-- Happend very often, hard to list all of them ;)

- Some sentences are sometimes too long and/or complex, keep it simple and precise (if possible).

- Some sentences seem very strange (in terms of syntax)

- Numbers below 13 should be written as words (one, twelve instead of 1, 12), if they are used outside of _an_ enumeration ;).

- Formal writing:
-- IMHO references like "section xyz" should start with capital S

- Plain TYPOS:
-- twice "form" instead of "from"
-- similiar mistakes

- IMHO: Sometimes the time is not correct
-- "Since 2015 OSLR will not be developed furthermore" - it sounds wrong somehow =P


Layout:
- Good and logical structure
- Font of figures could have been larger (preferable same size as text, if possible)
- Overall very well composed


Overall:
- Very good and interesting paper
- Very good presentation of problem, solution, related work and evaluation
- Room for improvements: Language (minor to medium), Layout (minor to nothing), Content (minor)


Good luck during presentation!
