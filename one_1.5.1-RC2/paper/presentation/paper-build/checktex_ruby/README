1) Intention
The tool is designed to check writing conventions, simple grammar 
constructs,... in the end, anything that can be matched with a string or
a regular expression.

2) Howto use
- call with 'ruby checktex.rb' 
- make the file executable 'chmod 744 checktex.rb' and then './checktex.rb'
The tool has a simple command line help.

3) Adding new rules
The file 'avoid_list' contains an number of expressions that are to be avoided in the 
Text. The tool checks for these expressions. The syntax of one line in the file ist
STRING,REPLACE,COMMENT 
REGEXP,REPLACE,COMMENT
String describes the match, Comment say why this is an exception,
Replace gives the String that should be written

4) Adding exceptions
In the file 'exception_list', Exceptions from the 'avoid_list' rules can be given.
If an expression in this file intersects with a match in the 'avoid_list', this will
not be treated as error. Nevertheless, it is still possible to show those lines that
contain exceptions. The Syntax for the file is:
STRING,COMMENT 
REGEXP,COMMENT
String describes the match, Comment say why this is an exception
